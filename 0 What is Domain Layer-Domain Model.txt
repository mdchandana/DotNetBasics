--The Domain Layer--
The domain layer is also called the business layer. It encapsulates business or domain logic and data. 
This layer might be deployed as an application server.




--Domain Model--
During the analysis phase of development a domain model is created to represent the business environment -
of the application.
During the design phase, details are added to the domain model and it becomes the domain layer of the 
application.
there are many classes in the domain layer. This can lead to complex dependencies between the presentation -
layer and the domain layer. 




--Domain Modeling--
Domain Modeling is a way to describe and model real world entities and the relationships between them, 
which collectively describe the problem domain space. Derived from an understanding of system-level requirements, 
identifying domain entities and their relationships provides an effective basis for understanding and helps 
practitioners design systems for maintainability, testability, and incremental development.
