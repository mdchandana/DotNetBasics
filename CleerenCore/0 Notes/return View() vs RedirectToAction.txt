===========return View()=================
It tells MVC to generate an HTML template to be displayed and sends it to the browser 
without making a new request. It does mean that it’s not changing the URL in the browser’s
address bar.

public ActionResult Index()  
{  
    return View();  
} 

===========return RedirectToAction()=================
To redirect to a different action which can be in the same or different controller. 
It tells ASP.NET MVC to respond with a browser to a different action instead of rendering 
HTML as View() method does. Browser receives this notification to redirect and makes a new 
request for the new action.

return RedirectToAction(“ActionName”,”ControllerName”);

Or this can be written as

return RedirectToAction(“~/ControllerName/ActionName”); 




=============================RedirectToAction====================================

---------------
-It's impossible to save state of current request, because... HTTP is stateless.
-Every RedirectToAction really tells browser to make another HTTP request. 
-If you would like to pass some data between HTTP requests, you have to use cookies
 or session mechanism.
-RedirectToAction also allows you to pass data on the query string via routeValues.
-you won't pass objects over the query string but you can say, pass the item id, then
 lookup the the id
 ----------------



 ----------------
 As mentioned, RedirecToAction will cause the browser to make a new request, and when 
 that new request comes in, it will create a totally new HttpContext. As mentioned, 
 To pass data between the two requests, you can use the query string, session or cookies.
 But there is another option to consider. (TempData)
 ----------------


 --------------
 1. Return View doesn't make a new requests, it just renders the view.
 2. without changing URLs in the browser's address bar. Return RedirectToAction makes a new 
    requests and URL in the browser's address bar is updated with the generated URL by MVC.
 3. Return Redirect also makes a new requests and URL in the browser's address bar is updated,
    but you have to specify the full URL to redirect
 4. Between RedirectToAction and Redirect, best practice is to use RedirectToAction for anything
    dealing with your application actions/controllers. If you use Redirect and provide the URL, 
    you'll need to modify those URLs manually when you change the route table.
 5. RedirectToRoute redirects to the specifies route defined in the the Route table.
