Once you've registered all your classes with the DI container (using IServiceCollection), 
pretty much all a DI container needs to do is allow you to retrieve an instance of an object using GetService().

Of course, you typically shouldn't be using the IServiceProvider directly in your code at all. 
Instead, you should be using standard constructor injection, and letting the framework worry about using 
IServiceProvider behind the scenes.
