Could not install package 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer 5.0.7'. 
You are trying to install this package into a project that targets '.NETFramework,Version=v4.7.2'
but the package does not contain any assembly references or content files that are compatible with that framework. 
For more information, contact the package author.


Solution=====
Just search and instal 'EntityFramework' from Nuget     NOT 'Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.SqlServer'

eg: Version Lke 6 (Entity Framework 6 (EF6))
    I've successfully installed 'EntityFramework 6.4.4' and compatibled with 'Mvc5'
